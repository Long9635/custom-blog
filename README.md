# custom-blog
Example of web application (custom blog), created by using Python 2.7 + Flask microframework + sqlite
# Installation
The sqlite database must be created before the application can run, and the db_create.py script takes care of that.
# Running
To run the application in the development web server just execute run.py (debug=True) or runp.py (debug=False) with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
